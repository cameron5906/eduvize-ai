# Introduction
Eduvize is a platform that enables anyone to learn a new skill without having to worry about imposter syndrome or falling behind on a proctored curriculum. With chat-based generative artificial intelligence becoming more and more popular and available, the tools are now in place to be able to build a platform that creates truly tailored learning plans and collaborative exercises for people to learn the way their minds want them to.
